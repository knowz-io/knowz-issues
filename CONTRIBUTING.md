# Contributing to Knowz

Thanks for your interest in improving Knowz! Here's how you can help.

## Reporting bugs

Good bug reports help us fix issues faster. Please include:

- **Clear title** summarizing the problem
- **Steps to reproduce** — the more specific, the better
- **Expected behavior** vs **actual behavior**
- **Screenshots or recordings** if applicable
- **Environment info** (browser, OS)

Use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/knowz-io/knowz-issues/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) to get started.

## Requesting features

When proposing a feature:

- **Describe the problem** you're trying to solve, not just the solution
- **Explain your use case** — how would this help your workflow?
- **Consider alternatives** — have you tried other approaches?

Use the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/knowz-io/knowz-issues/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).
